# ZHONX V
ZHONX V modelisation project

This new mouse is powered by two FAULHABER BLDC motors. Because these motors work at high RPM we have to find a new transmission strategy.

ZHONX V in a few words :
- FAULHABER Motor 0824 1,12 watt/gram, probably the best brushless motor of its category	
- Weight 40g
- Max speed 5m/s
- Max accel 20m/sÂ²
- Gear ratio 12
- max motor RPM (at 5m/s) 76000 RPM
